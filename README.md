# odin-recipes
The first The Odin Project ... project

This is a directory of three recipes containing images, links, and ordered/unordered lists.
This exercise will serve to familiarize me with the workflow of using git commits.

By the end of this exercise, I will be able to:
- structure a basic HTML page independently of step-by-step tutorials
- write effective commit messages

Upon reflection, I have:
- achieved all above goals, but recognize room for improvement with commit messages
- learned how to use Emmet's "Wrap with Abbreviation" function to quickly create lists
- made myself nervous about content laws by copying content from another website (see disclaimer below)

Disclaimer: I have copied content from Allrecipes, and explicitly do not claim ownership of any of the pictures or recipes. If there is a problem, contact me and I will promptly remove the all offending content from this repository. This was done for educational purposes only.

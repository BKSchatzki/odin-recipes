# odin-recipes
The first The Odin Project ... project

This is a directory of three recipes containing images, links, and ordered/unordered lists.
This exercise will serve to familiarize me with the workflow of using git commits.
By the end of this exercise, I will be able to:
- structure a basic HTML page independently of step-by-step tutorials
- write effective commit messages
